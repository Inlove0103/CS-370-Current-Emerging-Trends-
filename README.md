In all aspects of this project, it challenged me to implement a reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning to navigate a maze and find treasure. 
In various prompts and objectives, I was given a pseudocode and a basic environment setup, but I had to create the full Q-training loop, defining
the reward structure, and tune up hyperparameters to improve agent performance. Additionally, I had to document the design decisions and include visualizations 
to track learning progress. 
Throughout this course, I've deepened my understanding of how computer scientists approach problems methodically such as breaking them down into 
manageable components, testing hypotheses, and simpliyfing based on feedback from peers and instructors. This mindset helped me debug issues 
as much as possbile by correcting what errors I recieve, incorrect state transitions and refine my exploration strategy. 
Computer scientists build systems that provide shape to how people live, ,work, and connect. With the amount of trouble and obstacles we go through with 
coding, our work matters because it powers everything from healthcare to Cybersecurity, and it must be both technically sound and ehtically grounded
In this project, I have to consider how an intelligent agent might behave in unpredicatable environments or even with me changing the smallest detail 
of numbers in a code. The transparency in design helps users have more trust in the system. 
In my future coding and designs, my ehtical responsibilities has to prioritize user safety, fairness, and clarity. I personally believe that from
building a pirate agent to securing a real-world application, I aim to document my work thourghly, avoid bias in any decision- making, and ensure 
that technology not only serves company goals but end user's dignity.
